HANK
--------------------------

a twitter [poet/cat/amalgamation of dumb scripts](https://twitter.com/pataphysyllabus) bot thing. mostly a training ground for nanogenmo :muscle:

fetches some song lyrics and some poems, trains a bayes classifier with them (hey why not), mashes some lines together, replaces words with other words, adds a bunch of unicode chars, and then tweets the result.
